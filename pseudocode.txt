processes are:
	-ready to use a CPU
	-actively using a CPU
	-blocked on I/O
	-NOTE: by chance, no processes will be in queue, then exit program

/* PARAMETERS */

# of processes: by default
int n=12

# of cpu's: by default
int m=4


/* ALGORITHMS TO IMPLEMENT */

SJF_No_Preemption
SJF_Preemptive
RR
Preemptive_Priority
	-priority levels 0-4
	-same priority handled FCFS
	-higher priority entering can preempt
	-every elapsed 1200ms, lower priority processes increase by 1


/* TYPES OF PROCESSES TO HANDLE */

P_int=80% interactive processes
	-burst times 20-200ms
	-interactive time 1000-4500ms
	-returned to ready queue

P_cpu=20% cpu bound processes
	-burst times 200-3000ms
	-b=8 such bursts before terminating
	-between bursts blocked on I/O, 1200-3200ms
